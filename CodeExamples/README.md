# Code Examples

This directory contains (limited) code to generate random objects (only strings as of this moment)
as well as traces for them. 

The default behavior of the code is to create two files:
    - "originalSequence.txt": A file storing the original sequence (or object), so that algorithms can check to see if their reconstruction is correct
    - "traces.txt":           A file storing the traces of the sequence (or object), generally to be used as input for an algorithm.

The code is really here to help make the problem concrete for those that require it. I do not expect many (if any) algorithms
from the papers will be implemented here, though I welcome pull requests with algorithm implementations.
