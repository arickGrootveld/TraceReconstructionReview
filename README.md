# TraceReconstructionReview
Welcome to Trace Reconstruction Review (TRR), a central repository for all things trace reconstruction.

We've got string trace reconstruction, we've got tree trace reconstruction, we've got graph trace reconstruction. 

The goal of TRR is to track all the current work on trace reconstruction problems, with a short overview, and 
results stated in a comparable manner. 

All works stored in this repository are not owned by the creators of this repository, we are purely curators. 

If you think we missed something, feel free to make a pull request or to contact me directly. All complaints should be directed to my advisor (gandikota.venkata@gmail.com).
